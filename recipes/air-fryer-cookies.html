    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <li>½ cup butter, softened</li>
        <li>½ cup packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 ⅓ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 cup miniature semisweet chocolate chips</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut a piece of parchment paper to fit an air fryer basket.</li>
        <li>Beat butter in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium to high speed for 30 seconds. Add brown sugar, white sugar, baking soda, and salt; beat on medium speed for 2 minutes, scraping bowl occasionally. Beat in egg and vanilla extract until combined. Add flour, beating in as much as you can. Stir in any remaining flour, and chocolate chips.</li>
